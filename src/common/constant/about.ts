	I'm Harika, a Software Engineer with a strong passion for building 
	effective software solutions that cover both the intricacies of backend 
	logic and the aesthetics of frontend design.

	My expertise spans both backend and frontend development. Equipped with a skill 
	set that includes Java, Python, JavaScript, Dart, HTML, and CSS, I excel in full-stack 
	development. I am proficient in creating intricate RESTful APIs, developing responsive 
	applications, and enhancing user interfaces using frameworks like Spring Boot, React, 
	React Native, Node.js, and Flutter.

	After completing my undergraduate degree in Hyderabad, I gained substantial professional 
	experience at Coforge, spending 2.3 years there as an intern first and then a Software Engineer.

	Seeking to deepen my expertise and satisfy my desire for learning and intellectual challenge, 
	I then moved to the United States to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the 
	University of Washington.

<p>
	Beyond the realm of software development, I am an avid dancer and singer, proficient in 
	Western dance, Bharatanatyam, and Kuchipudi. I have also trained in Carnatic music and 
	enjoy singing in my spare time.

<p>
	My dedication to personal growth extends to my hobbies, which include yoga, pilates, strength 
	training, animal flow workouts, and recently pickleball, intrigued by its growing popularity. 
	An enthusiastic photographer and outdoorsy person, I thrive in natural settings and am passionate 
	about organizing events.

	During my undergrad, I served as the president of the IT club 'Ingenuity', spearheading numerous 
	tech events. I also stood as an organizer for various non-tech events and gatherings, fostering 
	community and collaboration.
